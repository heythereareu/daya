Zuurvi M-F Genius Grand Edition, Virat Endorsed, Full Size (SH) Natural Popular Willow Cricket Bat are engineered to maximise the size of the sweet spot, allowing the middle of the bat to be spread further across the blade meaning that off centre strikes perform better. Designed to enhance the position of the hands by placing them ahead of the ball, which is essential for good stroke play. The handle is made from premium, imported cane covered with high-quality grip to deliver superior power and control. Handmade using reinforced wood for long-term strength, this is the perfect bat for home or club play. It features an excellent handle, reinforced with firmly wound string and a rubber sleeve for increased durability. This cricket bat is designed to be used with a Soft/Hard tennis cricket ball only (Not recommended for leather balls).
